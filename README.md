Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) through TEA method.
To create a generalize techno economic model in Excel which can be utilized to find viability of technical and 
economical parameters.
A Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analysis (TEA) of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) is a study aimed at 
evaluating the impact of various technical and economic parameters on the viability of the CCUS system. This analysis is typically performed using 
a techno-economic model created in Microsoft Excel, which is designed to estimate the technical and economic performance of the CCUS system.
The TEA method involves considering different values for a set of input parameters and analyzing how these values affect the performance and 
economic viability of the system. The sensitivity analysis aspect of the TEA method determines which parameters have the greatest impact on the results,
while the uncertainty analysis aspect assesses the variability of the results given the uncertainty in the input parameters.
The goal of the TEA study is to provide insight into the factors that are critical for the successful implementation of the CCUS system, and to identify areas
where further research and development may be necessary. The results of the TEA analysis can be used by policymakers and industry stakeholders to make 
informed decisions about the future of CCUS technology.
